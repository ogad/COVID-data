# Coronavirus in the UK
## Visualisations and elementary analysis
The goal of this project is to make simple visualisations of the case, death and testing data for different regions of the UK, using the data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK data and API, developed by Public Health England and NHSX. These files contain public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.
## Example visualisations
These visualisations each use a 7-day rolling average to draw attention to the overall trend and reduce the effect of variations during the working week and noise.
## Cases by nation throughout the pandemic
## Deaths by nation throughout the pandemic
## Positivity rate by nation throughout the pandemic
The y-axis is limited here to a maximum of 0.05, to better visualise the more recent data. This is needed due to a large spike during the first wave of cases.
## Cases by the upper-tier local authority
This displays cases in a small number of local authorities. Here the cases are by specimen date, which leads to a downtick for the most recent dates, due to reporting lag.
