# Coronavirus in the UK

## Visualisations and elementary analysis
The goal of this project is to make simple visualisations of the case, death and testing data for different regions of the UK, using the data from the [Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/developers-guide) data and API, developed by Public Health England and NHSX. 
The population data is from the mid-year population estimates, `Mid 2019: April 2019 local authority district codes', which is made available by the ONS [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland).

## Example visualisations
These visualisations each use a 7-day rolling average to draw attention to the overall trend and reduce the effect of variations during the working week and noise.

This displays cases in a small number of local authorities. Here the cases are by specimen date, which leads to a downtick for the most recent dates, due to reporting lag. In order to combat this effect the data from the most recent days has been omitted.
